# sync - start the backend + ngrok tunnel in one command.
#
# Usage:
#   npm run sync
#   ./scripts/sync.sh
#
# Takes the port and the tunnel back by force before starting, then refuses to
# claim success until it has actually fetched something through the public URL.
# The version this replaced did neither, which produced the two failures worth
# naming here:
#
#   * A previous run still holding :4000 made the new server exit with
#     EADDRINUSE, while the script carried on and printed a working banner.
#   * ngrok's agent can lose its session to the relay and never get it back —
#     the process is still running, so nothing local looks wrong, but the
#     public URL answers ERR_NGROK_3200 and the deployed site reports the
#     backend as down.
#
# Both are invisible from inside the script unless it goes and checks, so it
# checks.
