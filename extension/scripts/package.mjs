/**
 * Zip the extension for someone else's browser.

 * Sideloading is the whole distribution story here, so this exists to make

 * ritual that quietly picks up `.DS_Store` and a stale build.
 *
 * Deliberately not a build step. There is nothing to compile — the extension
 * is plain JavaScript on purpose, so what ships is exactly what is in the
 * repo, and anyone can read the thing they are being asked to install.
