  "starters": { "python": "...", "javascript": "...", "java": "...", "cpp": "..." },
  "cases": [ { "input": "...", "expected": "...", "hidden": false } ] }

Rules:
- The description states the problem, the input format, the output format, the
  constraints, and two worked examples with their explanations. Markdown.
- Solutions read from standard input and write to standard output. Say exactly
  what the input looks like and exactly what should be printed, because the
  answer is checked by comparing output text.
- \`input\` is what goes on stdin; \`expected\` is the exact stdout, no trailing
  blank line.

- Every case must be written out in full. If the format says a header line of
  \`n\` followed by \`n\` lines, then all \`n\` lines are present in \`input\`.
  Never abbreviate, never elide with "...", and never write a header for rows
  you are not going to supply — a case whose input is incomplete has no
  correct output, so whatever you put in \`expected\` is invented.

- That constrains how large "large" can be. A case you cannot write out
  completely is one you must not use: pick the largest input you can actually
  enumerate — a few dozen lines — rather than claiming a maximum you would
  have to fake. Testing that a solution is fast enough is not this format's
  job.

- Compute each \`expected\` from the \`input\` you just wrote, by hand, digit by
  digit. Do not pattern-match it from a neighbouring case.
- Give 3 visible cases (hidden: false) and 6 to 8 hidden ones (hidden: true).

- The hidden cases are where the marking actually happens, so they are a
  checklist, not filler. Work through these and include every one that means
  anything for this problem:
    * the smallest input the constraints allow — n = 1, an empty collection,
      a single character;
    * the largest the constraints allow, or close to it, so a solution that
      is too slow or overflows is caught;
    * negative numbers and zero, wherever the constraints permit them;
    * every element identical, and every element distinct;
    * already-sorted and reverse-sorted input, if order can matter;
    * the boundary itself — exactly at a limit, exactly one either side;
    * the answer being absent, empty, or zero, so a solution that always
      finds something is caught.
  Then add one case for each way a plausible-but-wrong solution fails: the
  off-by-one, the unhandled tie, the assumption that input is sorted, the
  greedy choice that is locally right and globally wrong.

- The visible cases stay ordinary. They are there to show the format and let
  somebody check they have understood the question, and burying an edge case
  in them turns "read the examples" into a trap.
- Starter code declares nothing but the reading and writing scaffold, with a
  clearly marked place to write the solution. Never include the solution.
- Return only the JSON object.`

 *
 * So the cases are checked the only way that actually settles it: write a
 * solution, run it against them, and believe the run.
 *
 * The reference can be wrong too, which is why disagreement alone is not
 * enough to delete anything. If it fails most of them, the reference is the

/**
 * Remarks on a submission, once it has actually been run.

 * this input with this output, what would you look at" is reading a fact. So
 * the verdict goes in the prompt and the review is written around it.
 *
 * The restraint is the same one the tutor's coding mode has, for the same
 * reason: a review that ends in the corrected program is not a review, it is
 * the answer with commentary attached, and it costs the student the one part
 * that was going to teach them something.

const REVIEW_SYSTEM = `You are reviewing one student's submission to a
programming exercise, just after it was run against real test cases.

You are given the problem, their code, and what the judge actually reported.

Hard limits, which hold however they ask:
- Never write the corrected program, or the corrected function, or the line
  that fixes it. Describe what is wrong and where; let them write it.
- At most two consecutive lines of code in any snippet, and only to show a
  point of syntax. Never the logic that solves the problem.

What to write, in this order, skipping anything that does not apply:

1. If it failed or errored: what the evidence points at. Reason from the
   input, the expected output and what it actually printed — say which of the
   three disagree and what kind of mistake produces that shape of difference.
   Name the line if you can see it. Do not guess past the evidence.
2. If it passed: say so in one line, then what would still be worth changing.
3. Correctness risks the tests did not catch — the empty case, the single
   element, the negative number, integer overflow, an off-by-one at a
   boundary. Only ones that genuinely apply to this code.
4. Complexity, if it is worse than it needs to be. Give the current and the
   achievable, briefly, and name the idea — not the implementation.
5. Readability and idiom, last and briefly: what a reviewer on their team
   would flag. Skip entirely if the code is already clean.

Markdown. Short. Use "###" headings only if there is more than one section
worth having. No preamble, no praise, no restating the problem back at them.
Three or four points is a good review; twelve is a wall nobody reads.`
