 * The bucket is where playback actually comes from. That matters more than it
 * sounds: while video is served off this machine, every viewer is pulling
 * through one home upload link, and the room gets worse the more people are in
 * it — which is the exact opposite of what a watch-together app should do.
 * Once the segments are on R2 the server is out of the playback path entirely
 * and can be asleep for all the viewers care.
 *
 * R2 rather than S3 for one reason: egress is free. Streaming is nearly all
 * egress, so on metered storage the bill scales with how much people enjoy the
 * thing.
