 * the SDP and ICE they exchange; the audio and video go directly between
 * browsers. That is what "mesh" means here, and it is why this file is small —
 * the alternative, an SFU, would mean running a media server.
 *
 * Mesh cost grows with the square of the room: every participant holds a
 * connection to every other. Fine for the handful of people a room is designed
 * for, which is why `MAX_PEERS` is a real limit rather than a formality.

 * badge and, at the limit, can wedge a room at "call full" with nobody in it.
