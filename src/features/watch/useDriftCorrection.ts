 * stalled client is behind by definition, gets yanked forward, stalls again on
 * the fresh buffer, and seek-loops until the network catches up. So:
 *
 * - While the player reports buffering, do nothing at all.
 * - And for a while *after* it, too: the room's clock ran on while the player
 *   stalled, so a player that has just recovered is behind by definition, and
 *   reading that as fresh drift is what restarts the loop.
 * - Where the source allows any playback rate, absorb small drift by running
 *   fractionally fast or slow, which nobody can see. Seeking is the last
 *   resort, because a visible jump is worse than 400ms of being behind.
 * - Where it does not — YouTube only accepts its own rate list — every
 *   correction costs a rebuffer, so small drift is simply tolerated and the
 *   threshold for a jump is wider.
