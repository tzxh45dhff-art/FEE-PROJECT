 * A full-mesh WebRTC call.

 * Every participant holds a peer connection to every other one, and media goes
 * browser to browser — the server only introduces people and relays SDP/ICE.
 * That keeps the infrastructure at zero, at the cost of scaling: n participants
 * means n−1 uploads each, which is fine for the handful of people a room is for
 * and would not be for forty.
 *
 * Negotiation follows the "perfect negotiation" pattern. Both sides add their
 * tracks as soon as they know about each other, so both try to offer at once;
 * rather than trying to elect an initiator, one side is designated polite and
 * rolls back when it collides. Comparing socket ids gives both ends the same
 * answer without another round trip.
