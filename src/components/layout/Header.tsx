   * html2canvas and refracts the picture. It is a lovely effect on a static
   * page and a liability on this one: the photograph is taken once and goes
   * stale the moment anything under the bar moves, it cannot see a `<video>`

   * as a flat dark rectangle with a hard edge — which is exactly what it was
   * doing over the new hero.
   *
   * A real `backdrop-filter` blurs whatever is genuinely underneath, every
   * frame, including the parallaxing hero image. It is also what the rest of
   * the app already uses, so the bar now matches the surfaces it floats over.
