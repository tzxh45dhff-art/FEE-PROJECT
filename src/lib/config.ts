/**
 * Where the backend lives, and how we prove who we are.
 *
 * In local development this is empty: Vite proxies `/api`, `/socket.io` and
 * `/uploads` to the server, so everything is same-origin and the session cookie
 * does the work on its own.
 *
 * A deployed frontend has no proxy. `VITE_API_URL` points it at the API's real
 * origin, and from that moment every request is cross-site — which is why the
 * token below exists.
 *
 * It can also be set at runtime, with `?api=…` once. That exists because the
 * API here is a laptop behind a tunnel: baking its address in at build time
 * means a redeploy of the frontend every time that address moves, to change
 * one string. Stored per browser, so it survives reloads and outlives the
 * link that set it.
